Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most technologically and highly complicated manufacturing processes. Traditional machine learning algorithms such as uni-variate and multivariate analyses have long been deployed as a tool for creating predictive model to detect faults. In the past decade major collaborative research projects have been undertaken between fab industries and academia in the areas of predictive modeling. In this study we propose machine learning techniques to automatically generate an accurate predictive model to predict equipment faults during the wafer fabrication process of the semiconductor industries. Aim at constructing a decision model to help detecting as quickly as possible any equipment faults in order to maintain high process yields in manufacturing.
